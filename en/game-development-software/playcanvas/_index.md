PlayCanvas is a free open source game making software for mobile or desktop browsers. It is robust, flexible, and comes with self-hosting capabilities. In addition, this web based game engine is based on WebGL, HTML5 and offers utilities to speed up the development processes. Further, it is used for game development and used for Animations, Ads, Virtual reality, and Augmented reality. Moreover, this web-based game engine lets users work collaboratively where users can invite other team members to work on projects. It provides fine support for mobile-based browsers where it loads very quickly by using various features such as script concatenation, deferred loading of non-essential assets, minification, and more.

This free video gaming software supports advanced 2D + 3D graphics. After that, game developers have the provision to add animations for characters and scenes. Moreover, it uses 3D rigid-body physics engine Ammo.js and 3D positional sounds built on the Web Audio API. Above all, users can write scripts for game behaviors in TypeScript or JavaScript.

However, PlayCanvas is written in JavaScript. Therefore, there is comprehensive documentation available regarding the development and deployment of this free web based game engine.
