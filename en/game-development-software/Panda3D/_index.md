Panda3D is an open source framework for building real-time 3D games. It provides rich animations, virtualization, and simulation. In addition, it is multiplatform and comes with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Moreover, it is flexible and provides a complete environment to produce innovative games. Further, this 3D game development software offers command-line tools to manage and optimize the source assets. This free tool is highly extensible and integrates third-party libraries such as Bullet physics engine, Assimp model loader, and OpenAL. However, there is an over-the-network profiling system that lets users understand frame movement.

This open source game maker is easy to set up and comes with self-hosting capabilities. Moreover, it provides quick prototyping features. Above all, it provides an SDK that can be downloaded for game development and game developers can implement their gaming ideas using C++ and Python.

After that, Panda3D is written in C++, Python along with the input from some other languages. Therefore, there is comprehensive documentation available regarding the development and deployment of this free game development software.
