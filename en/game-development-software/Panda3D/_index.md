Panda3D is an open source framework for building real-time 3D games. This video game editor provides rich animations, virtualization, and simulation. In addition, it is multiplatform and comes with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Moreover, it is flexible and provides a complete environment to produce innovative games. Further, this 3D game development software offers command-line tools to manage and optimize the source assets. This free tool is highly extensible and integrates third-party libraries such as Bullet physics engine, Assimp model loader, and OpenAL. However, there is an over-the-network profiling system that lets users understand frame movement.

After that, this open source game maker is easy to set up and comes with self-hosting capabilities. Moreover, this web game editor provides quick prototyping features.
