Defold is a free open source game creation platform. It is built on top of the component-based architecture. Moreover, the modular echo system provides better performance. It is mainly developed to focus on 2D games. However, this free game development software is capable of building 3D games. In addition, it provides 2D sprites, Spine models, and Tile map editor for 2D levels. There is also provision for 3D models, shaders are written in GLSL and lets its users create and modify 3D geometry at runtime. Then, this game building platform provides a particle effects editor with a live preview of emitter and modifier behavior and a Curve editor for controlling particle parameter changes over particle lifespan.

This video game software comes up with professional animation. Therefore, it includes Flipbook animations, Spine and model animations, and Property animations. Above all, this game development tool offers a user-friendly scene editor along with advanced physics simulations. Further, it is highly extensible where users can write scripts for the required functionality.

After that, Defold is written in C++, C along with input from some other languages. Therefore, there is comprehensive documentation available regarding the development and deployment of this free game creation platform.
