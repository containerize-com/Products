### **System Requirements**
-------------------

To install Tuleap you will need a fully dedicated server. It can be virtualized or physical. It is not recommended to install Tuleap on a server that hosts other applications. Tuleap provides a full suite of software and is deeply integrated with its host system. Installing Tuleap on a mutualized server will certainly cause probleme in both Tuleap and your other applications.
