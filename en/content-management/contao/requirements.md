System Requirements
-------------------

The minimum requirements depend on whether you are installing the latest or the Long Term Support version. All maintained versions of Contao are compatible with the latest PHP and MySQL versions. Therefore, we recommend to always use them.

1. PHP: Version 7.4+ (latest patch version)
2. MySQL: Version 8.0+ or equivalent MariaDB server
