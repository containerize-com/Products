#### Overview

Concrete5 CMS is amongst the most popular content management systems available in the open source world. It is considered as an alternative to WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.

Concrete5 has a modular editing system, so you can edit the pages without having knowledge of coding. You just pick the module you want to insert or edit and click where you want it to go. Additionally, you are able to edit modules in an HTML format if you would like to, so if you have the knowledge you can have even more control over your modules.

Easy to maintain, good security. No need for external plugins in order to perform advanced features. In a crowded market space, Concrete5 stands out as a solution that pairs robust functionality with ease of use and a low cost of deployment.

Concrete5 CMS is developed using PHP Programming Language. Therefore, gives developers full control over the display, and lets the editor plot the correct values.

Concrete5 has a good user community and support forums, as well as paid add-ons which provide advanced functionality that other open-source CMSs can lack.

Concrete5 CMS has a one-click update feature. As a result, it is really handy to update. Don't have to download a bunch of files locally. Then, upload it, and then run a separate update process to update Concrete5.

You can use Concrete5 CMS for any website. But, not suitable for webshops. Sure there are plugins. But, better to go with a dedicated e-commerce platform like Prestashop.
