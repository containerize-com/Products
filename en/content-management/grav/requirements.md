### **System Requirements**
-------------------

Grav is intentionally designed with few requirements. You can easily run Grav on your local computer, as well as 99% of all Web hosting providers. If you have a pen handy, jot down the following Grav system requirements:

1. Web Server (Apache, Nginx, LiteSpeed, Lightly, IIS, etc.)
2. PHP 7.1.3 or higher
3. hmm... that's it really, (but please look at PHP requirements for a smooth experience)!
 
Grav is built with plain text files for your content. There is no database needed.
