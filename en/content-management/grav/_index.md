#### Overview

A flat-file CMS is an open source file-based content management system (CMS). It stores files and data in text files and folders rather than a database. Therefore, Grav CMS requires no installing. Since all of its components are pre-installed and all it takes to set it up is to simply download it and extract an archive. It is open source and has all the source code available at [Github](https://github.com/getgrav/grav).

Like most CMS platforms, Grav CMS offers the best technology in the business. The main idea behind that is to create a platform that is easy-to-use and attractive in terms of web design. But, it has other advantages. Like, user-friendly way of extending and modifying each theme. You can take out what you do not like on your site and add what you can find a use of.

There are two versions of Grav that can be installed – a standalone version without a UI, and a version that includes an admin plugin that creates a user dashboard much like we’re used to in WordPress.

The Grav CMS Admin bundle includes a neat-looking dashboard. As a result, it lets you manage the website and create new pages without having to manually edit any files. If you’ve used any CMS dashboard before, you’ll feel right at home.

Grav CMS is a PHP based content management system. It requires PHP 5.5.9 or above, which means it can take advantage of many features of PHP that WordPress can’t, due to WordPress still supporting PHP 5.2.4.

Grav has a powerful API and sophisticated Package Manager to make it super flexible.
