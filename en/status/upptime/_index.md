Upptime is an **open source status page** system. It offers **free website monitoring service** as well. Upptime is powered by GitHub and uses its features for performing different operations. So, it is different from traditional status page systems because it does not require a server. Upptime uses three main features of GitHub such as Actions, Issues, and Pages. GitHub Actions is used as an uptime monitor. GitHub Issues are used for incident reports and GitHub Pages are used for the status website.

GitHub Actions allows users for scheduling workflows to automatically run every 5 minutes or so. Upptime checks the health status of the website every 5 minutes or whatever defined. GitHub Issues work as incident reports. Upttime opens a new issue in the GitHub repository when the website/endpoint goes down. The issue can be assigned to a team member and send notification using one of the configured notification channels. Upptime uses GitHub pages for rendering status website. **GitHub statuspage** shows users information such as website's status, incident history, and response time graphs.

This **free status page software** comes with various channels for sending notifications such as Slack, Telegram, Discord, Email, and SMS. Send notification to team members either the website goes down or experiences degraded performance. Further, users can manually run triggers along with automated workflows. Moreover, this **open source status page** system consists of three packages including @upptime/uptime-monitor, @upptime/status-page, and @upptime/graphs.
