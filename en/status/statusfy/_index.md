### **Overview** 
Statusfy is a free status page to showcase services uptime. It is an easy to use and open source status page system.
It can be used by developers to create and deploy a fast static created or server rendered site to a variety of hosting services. Simply build incidents in Markdown, and Statusfy will produce all of the logic needed for the status page system. It allows developers to create a web application from the command line, allowing it to be easily customized to meet their needs.

Since page loading speed is critical for gaining visitor confidence, Statusfy's core feature is the Progressive Web App. PWA speeds up page loading by loading only the most important HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data at first. Use your own logo and configure the default theme to maintain your brand's requirements. Without incurring costly server, deploy a static-generated status page system to a variety of hosting services.
