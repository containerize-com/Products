PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database management system. It extends the SQL language and adds many additional features. PostgreSQL is the most advanced DBMS software because of its proven architecture, reliability, data integrity, robust feature set as well as extensibility, and disaster recovery. Moreover, the dedication of its open source community consistently delivers performant and innovative solutions. PostgreSQL runs on all major operating systems. It has powerful add-ons such as the popular PostGIS geospatial database extender.

PostgreSQL open source rdbms comes with many features aimed to help developers develop applications. It protects data integrity and makes a fault-tolerant environment. Moreover, PostgreSQL is highly extensible, as you can define your custom data types, build out custom functions, even write code from different programming languages without recompiling the database. PostgreSQL supports most of the features required by the SQL standard but sometimes with slightly differing syntax or function.
