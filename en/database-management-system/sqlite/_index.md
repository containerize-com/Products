SQLite DBMS is a Library of C-language that acts as a database engine. It is a small, fast, self-contained as well as highly-reliable and open source DBMS software. It is a built-in or embedded database engine, so it doesnâ€™t require any configuration on your system. SQLite DBMS is available for different platforms like Windows (Win32, WinCE, WinRT) and also for UNIX (Linux, Mac OS-X, Android, iOS). No external dependencies are required for SQLite because it is self-contained. This SQLite DMBS is stored in a single cross-platform disk file.

SQLite is lightweight in terms of setup, database administration, and required resources. The SQLite open source database engine can be linked statically or dynamically as per the requirement of the application. It is the most widely deployed database engine. It can be faster than direct file system I/O, even its performance is good in low-quality environments. It is a complete database that contains views, multiple tables, and triggers in a single disk file. SQLite is server-less as it does not require a separate server process or system to operate like other RDMBS. SQLite transactions are fully ACID-compliant.
