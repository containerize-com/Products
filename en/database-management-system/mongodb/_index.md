### **Overview**
MongoDB is a secure and easy to scale and open source NoSQL database. It can be used in supporting content management systems, e-commerce systems, mobile applications, data analytics section, archiving as well as online and offline gaming applications. MongoDB is a document-based database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. MongoDB is schema-less so there is no need of schema migration. It has rich and expressive query language that allows you to filter and sort by any field. Queries are themselves JSON, and thus easily composable. No more concatenating strings to dynamically generate SQL queries.

MongoDB provides fast accessing of data because of its nature of implementing the internal memory to store the data. It handles structured as well as unstructured data within various types of applications. Document -based query language is used for dynamic queries on documents. MongoDB also provides rich collection of DB queries. As it is document-oriented so Number of fields, content and size of the document can be different from one document to another. It can be easily set-up and scalable. Data can be updated very quickly. MongoDB can be used as a file system, called GridFS, with load balancing and data replication features over multiple machines for storing files.
