### **Overview**

TDengine is an open source big data framework. It is a big data system designed for the Internet of things (IoT). It is a highly scalable, reliable, and high-performance free big data platform for the processing of large-scale data. TDengine comes with features such as caching, stream computing, message queuing, and many more for reducing development and operation costs. It serves as a relational database and a fast platform for storing, querying, and analyzing time-series data. Because of its storage design, this open source big data platform is at least 10 times faster than other databases. On a single-core machine, TDengine can handle up to 20K queries per second and retrieve up to 10 million data points per second.

TDengine provides a robust data analysis tool that allows companies to do Ad Hoc queries or analyzes using the TDengine shell, Python, R, or Matlab. Developers can swiftly install and run it. Further, there are no other dependencies. Moreover, Standard SQL can be used with connectors including C/C++, Java, Python, Go, RESTful, and Node.JS. This big data framework can be easily integrated with other tools without a single line of code including Telegraf, Grafana, Matlab, R MQTT, OPC, Hadoop, Spark, and many more. TDengine is developed in C, Python, Java and comes with all the documentation regarding development and deployment. The license for this open source big data platform is AGPL-3.0.
