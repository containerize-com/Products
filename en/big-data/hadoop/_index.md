### **Overview**

Hadoop is a free and open source big data tool. It is robust, reliable, and scalable big data analytics software. HDFS (High Distributed File System), MapReduce, and YARN are the three key components of Hadoop. HDFS is a storage layer that is made up of two kinds of nodes: NameNodes and DataNodes. The metadata about a block's location is stored in NameNode. In a predetermined period, DataNodes stores the block and sends block reports to NameNode. The MapReduce processing layer is divided into two phases: the Map phase and the Reduce phase. It is intended for concurrent processing of data that is distributed across several nodes. In Hadoop big data, YARN is the job scheduling and resource management layer.

Hadoop is one of the best big data software for processing large data. Hadoop cluster is highly scalable, so it allows horizontal and vertical scaling to the Hadoop framework. It has a fault tolerance function that relies on a replication mechanism to ensure fault tolerance. Hadoop ensures that data is still available, even when things aren't going well. If one of the DataNodes fails, the user can access data from other DataNodes that have a copy of the same data. Hadoop is a distributed data storage system that enables data to be processed through a cluster of nodes. As a result, it gives the Hadoop framework lightning-fast processing capabilities.
