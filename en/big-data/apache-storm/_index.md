Apache Storm is a real-time data processing platform that is open source. It's a simple, user-friendly big data processing tool that works with any programming language. It can be incorporated in both small and large businesses. It is highly scalable and can maintain efficiency even when the load increases by adding resources in a linear manner. Apache Storm processes data streams in real time, while Hadoop processes data in batches. Any queueing and database technologies can be integrated with Apache Storm. It guarantees data processing even if one or more of the cluster's linked nodes dies or messages are lost.

Apache Storm has four components including Tuple, Stream, Spouts, and Bolts. In Apache Storm, the tuple is the primary data structure. It supports all data types and has a list of ordered elements. Stream is an unordered sequence of tuples. Spouts is a source of streams that is used to read data from data sources. The main interface for implementing spouts is ISpout. Further, there are numerous interfaces available, including IRichSpout, BaseRichSpout, and KafkaSpout. Bolts are components of logical processing. Spouts send information to the bolts and bolts process, which results in a new output stream. The central interface for implementing bolts is called "IBolt." For real-time big data stream processing, Apache Storm is well-known. As a result, many large corporations use it, including Twitter, NaviSite, Wego, Yahoo, and many others.
