### Full-featured, easy to use, compatible ... and free!

FreeOffice is a full-featured open-source office suite with word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software. It is seamlessly compatible with Microsoft Office and available for Windows, Mac and Linux.Best of all, it's completely free for both personal and commercial use.

### Compatibility without compromises

With FreeOffice you can not only open, but also save documents in the Microsoft file formats DOCX, XLSX and PPTX. Share files directly with Microsoft Office users, without having to export them first!

### It's your choice: ribbons or classic menus

This open-source office suite offers a completely revised user interface. You can work with either modern ribbons or classic menus and toolbars. Even better: menus are also available with the new ribbon user interface. This makes switching from the old user interface especially easy. The new quick access toolbar lets you access the most important functions quickly.

### Optimized for touchscreens

If you use a computer with a touchscreen, you can now switch to touch mode with larger icons and increased spacing between user-interface elements. This new touch mode is available both with ribbons and with the classic menu-based user interface.
