### More performance, more compatibility

LibreOffice 7.0 is our latest major release, with better performance, improved compatibility, and many new features to boost your productivity.

### Cutting-edge technology

OpenDocument, LibreOffice's native file format, has been updated to version 1.3. In addition, many improvements have been made to Microsoft Office OOXML document compatibility - DOCX, XLSX and PPTX.

### Geared towards your workflow

LibreOffice 7.0 includes various usability improvements. Bookmarks and fields can now be protected to prevent accidental changes to them, while bookmarks can be shown inline in text. The Navigator has many tweaks to make it easier to work with, while handling of quotation marks and apostrophe in several languages has been updated too.

### Professional shine for your documents

New shapes galleries have been added: arrows, diagrams, icons and more. Objects can have glow and soft edge effects, while semi-transparent text is now supported. And thanks to the new Skia graphics engine, this is all displayed with the best performance yet.
