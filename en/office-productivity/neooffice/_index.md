#### Overview

NeoOffice is a 100% free and open-source office suite for macOS. This is a great alternative to Microsoft Office if you are trying to switch from Microsoft Software but something a little cheaper which is 100% free in this case. Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice specifically for the Mac OS e.g Native Darkmode, Native Grammer Checking, Native file locking, and lots of other Native features.

Since NeoOffice is based on LibreOffice and OpenOffice, hence it also supports uses the OpenDocument Format (ODF), a fully open and ISO standardized file format that guarantees access to your data forever. If you are a mac user and looking for a free alternative to Microsoft Office for macOS. Then, NeoOffice is a very good choice for you.
