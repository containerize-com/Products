GitLab is one of the leading free **source code management** software. It was planned for the Linux OS. It can run on most Linux flavors, except Windows. In addition to **source control software**, it can be used for issue tracking, code review, CI/CD, and many more. Further, it can be deployed on a private server by using source code and a container.

GitLab is a full DevOps open source platform and its central feature is version control. A significant aspect of software creation is **source code management**. GitLab helps to communicate and improve productivity for software development teams. It also allows teams to use outstanding features such as code reviews, monitoring of asset versions, feedback loops, and strong branching.

This **open source version control** allows developers to work from a local copy to speed up the process of development. Creating a new branch, making changes, and merging into the master branch is a very simple flow. To streamline testing and delivery, GitLab provides built-in tools for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). With each commit, GitLab will automatically scan for code quality and security. Moreover, it allows teams to review code and approve merge requests.

GitLab is built in modern technologies such as Ruby, Go and Vue.js. It uses PostgreSQL database server to store information. The license for this **self hosted version control** software is MIT.
