Subversion is the ultimate free and open source **version control software**. It is a simple, easy-to-use, and reliable **source control system** for a variety of projects. Therefore, anyone from individuals to large-scale enterprises can use it.

**Apache Subversion** helps developers to collaborate and work together on the same project. Developers can manage directories, files, and the changes made to them. Besides, **svn version control** enables you to review history and recover older versions.

The Subversion comes with powerful and modern features such as branches, tags, merge tracking, file locking, conflict resolution, and many more. Branches are commonly used for the development of new features. You can easily merge the feature branch into the master branch with the help of this **centralized version control system**. The tag is used to create a snapshot of the project. Tags also allow developers to provide unique versions of the repository with concise and recognizable names.

This **version control software** has components for performing certain operations such as svn, svnversion, svnlook, svnadmin, and many more. svn is a command-line client program, whereas svnversion is a program for reporting the state of a working copy, and svnlook is a tool for inspecting the repository.
