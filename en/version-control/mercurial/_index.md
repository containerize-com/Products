Mercurial is an excellent open source **version control tool**. It is a **distributed version control system** like Git. Mercurial is quick, scalable and handles projects of all sizes effectively. Further, it is very simpler than Git that may attracts more developers to use it. Moreover, a wide variety of workflows are supported by Mercurial and you can easily enhance its functionality with extensions.

**Mercurial version control** is fast and performs most of the actions locally. It allows developers to easily generate diffs between revisions and switch in minutes. Therefore, it is perfectly suitable for large projects such as Nginx, NetBeans, and many more. Mercurial has powerful branching model, developers can easily create and merge branches.

Mercurial is largely written in Python, although some portion was in created C language created due to performance. It is a cross-platform **version control software** and binary releases are available for all major platforms. Mercurial is also extensible that means that developers can activate existing extensions to enhance functionality. However, it allows to write own extensions as per business requirements.
