### **Overview**

Celery is an open source, flexible, and reliable distributed message queue system to process vast amounts of messages. It is a task queue with focus on real-time processing while it also supports task scheduling. Celery is licensed under the BSD License. Celery has a simple asynchronous process queue or job queue which is based on distributed message passing. The execution units or process tasks are executed concurrently on a single or more worker nodes using multiprocessing, eventlet or gevent. Celery tasks run asynchronously in the background or synchronously.

Celery is written using Python but the protocol can be implemented in any language. Celery is used in production systems like for Instagram, to process millions of tasks every day. It can also work with other programming languages using webhooks. There is a PHP client, Go client, a Node.js client and a Ruby-Client called RCelery. Celery is an open source message queue with 17.7K GitHub stars and 4K GitHub forks.
