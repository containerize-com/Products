NGINX web server supports all the components of the modern Web including WebSocket, HTTP/2, and streaming of multiple video formats. It started out as a web server but now, it has developed to also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP). It also work as reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers. NGINX consistently beats Apache and other servers if measured on web server performance.

The software structure is asynchronous and event-driven. It enables the processing of multiple requests at the same time. NGINX web server is highly scalable, so its service grows along with its clients’ traffic. Nginx uses much less memory than Apache. It can handle roughly four times as many requests per second. NGINX is one of the most reliable servers for speed and scalability. Due to which, many high traffic websites have been using NGINX’s service. Some examples include Google, Netflix, Adobe, Cloudflare and WordPress.

Supported Platforms include:

- Linux
- Solaris
