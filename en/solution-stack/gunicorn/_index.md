### **Overview**

Gunicorn is unique as compared to many WSGI server implementations because it is highly stable and powers some of the largest Python-based web applications in the world including the famous social media platform Instagram. Gunicorn is a pure Python web server for WSGI applications. It provides a perfect balance of performance, flexibility, and configuration simplicity. It is also incredibly light on resources and you can set the priority of certain endpoints and retain performance on your servers for where it is needed the most.

Gunicorn web server is the only WSGI server for Python that is compatible with almost everything. This is the typical server that you might use when working with both Flask and Django, which are the two most popular web-frameworks for Python. One of the advantages of using Gunicorn is that it is fairly quick and resource friendly. Its architecture is fairly simple, which means that it can typically be implemented very easily and still run incredibly fast. It is primarily written in the C programming language, which means it is likely on top of any other server written in pure Python in terms of speed and performance.
