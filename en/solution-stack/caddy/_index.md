Caddy server is extremely easy to configure and use. It takes care of TLS certificate renewals, OCSP stapling, static file serving, reverse proxying, Kubernetes ingress, and much more. It is cross-platform, open source solution stack, and can run across all major operating systems including macOS, Linux and Windows. Caddy is a flexible and efficient static file web server as well as powerful and scalable reverse proxy.

Caddy is the only web server to use HTTPS by default. It renews TLS certificates automatically and staples OCSP responses. Caddy is written in Go language so it offers greater memory safety than servers written in C. Use Caddy server for compression, template evaluation and Markdown rendering of your web sites.

Use Caddy for reverse proxy, active and passive health checks, load balancing, circuit breaking and caching. It has everything Built-in with no dependencies so it runs great in containers. Which makes it simple to install and simple to upgrade. Caddy has its own apt repos for Debian-based distributions.
