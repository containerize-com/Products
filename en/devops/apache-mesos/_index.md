### **Overview**
Apache Mesos is an open source cluster management tool and it provides efficient physical resource isolation across distributed environments or applications. It was originally developed at the University of California at Berkeley and quickly adopted by many leading technology companies like Twitter. It ensures high availability and has an easy to use GUI interface.

Mesos cluster manager can handle workloads and shares resources across distributed applications and environments. It can run applications like Kafka, Hadoop, Jenkins, Spark, and many other in a dynamically shared pool of nodes. It seamlessly integrates with Apache Spark and behaves as a kernel for the data center. Apache Mesos cluster management software is completely written in C++ language, often using functional programming patterns.
