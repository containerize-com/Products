### **Overview**

Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container Docker applications defined using the Compose file format.  It can be tedious start, stop, rebuild and manage multiple containers manually, so Docker has created a new useful tool that helps speed up the process i.e Docker Compose. A Compose file works by applying rule defined how the one or more containers or services are configured in a docker-compose.yaml file. When you have a compose YAML file, you can create, start and manage your application with a single command: docker compose up.

Developing applications using Docker are challenging when working on multiple services and containers. Here come the Docker Compose that will help you to run docker multiple containers applications and environments. Docker Compose can handle multiple containers simultaneously in the docker compose production, staging, development, testing, and CI environments. You can use Docker Compose to manage the whole software development lifecycle (SDLC). Docker Compose open source software has 24.8K GitHub stars and 4.2k GitHub forks.
