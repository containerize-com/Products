### **Overview**

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration tool, meant to run across a cluster. It is also known as kube or k8s. It schedules and automates containerized applications deployment, scaling, and management  across multiple hosts. Kubernetes container orchestration software was originally developed and designed by engineers at Google. Then Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in mid 2014 and now it is maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

kubernetes K8 open source container orchestration platform, orchestrates container runtime systems private, public and hybrid cloud applications. It is container centric orchestration tool to schedule and manage containers. Open source container orchestration kubernetes builds on 15 years of running Google's containerized applications. It is free to use and can be downloaded from its repository on GitHub. Kubernetes open source software has 83.4K GitHub stars and 30.5k GitHub forks.
