Kubernetes open source orchestration system is the widespread adoption of containers among organizations, also known as kube or k8s. It has become the de facto standard for scheduling and automating computer applications to build, deploy, scale and manage containerized applications due to the flexible nature of kubernetes architecture. 

K8 kubernetes is used to manage Linux Containers across private, public and hybrid cloud environments. Kube is container-centric and focuses more on deploying and managing services. Kubernetes container orchestration platform was originally developed and designed by engineers at Google and Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in mid 2014.
