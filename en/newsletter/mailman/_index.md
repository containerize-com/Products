Every organization needs email marketing solutions that allow them to send updates and promotions of products. In order to find leads and turn them into clients, email marketing is also the cornerstone of every digital business. Mailman is perhaps the most prevalent, commonly used and free newsletter software on the Internet and you can use it for newsletter campaigns.

Mailman is a free and open source mailing list and newsletter manager that enables organizations to send bulk emails to any number of subscribers. Mailman only offers an interface for site administration. It does not send or receive emails on its own, but relies on Postfix, an external SMTP server.

Mailman is developed in Python. The license for this open source newsletter software is GNU General Public License.
