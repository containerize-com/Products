### **Overview**

GoCD is a free **continuous integration and continuous deployment** software. It helps software development teams to automate the testing and release process. It was designed for continuous delivery and developers can configure **pipelines as code**. It is a robust, scalable, extensible **open source continuous delivery** tool. GoCD comes with out-of-the-box features such as features like the ability to compare builds, parallel execution, visualize complex workflows, automate build version tracking, and many more.

End-to-end visualization is provided by GoCD, which means that the VSM (value stream map) displays the entire path to production in a single view. Developers can also easily navigate between tasks, identify inefficiencies, and optimize the process. GoCD streamlines continuous delivery workflows on popular cloud environments such as Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, and many more. GoCD assists users in troubleshooting a broken pipeline by monitoring all changes in real-time from commit to deployment. Users can compare the content of files and commit messages for any two builds. Further, this **continuous integration and continuous deployment** system supports plugins out of the box for the integration of external tools and services. There is a wide range of plugins available to perform different tasks. Moreover, developers can use the GoCD plugin API for the development of custom plugins.
