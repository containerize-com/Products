Software building, testing, and deployment is the most important task for development teams. Software delivery is a continuous job as teams frequently release new versions. The deployment tool enables development teams and individual developers to automate the software delivery process and focus on other important tasks. It is a free and **open source deployment tool** for automating the software delivery process. It's based on container technology. The Drone offers two versions such as Enterprise edition, and community edition. Enterprise edition is paid one whereas community edition is free to use. This **free software deployment** platform supports multiple operating systems. Further, it works with any language and database.

This **open source continuous integration tool** allows development teams to easily configure pipelines. Each pipeline runs in a container that is isolated and downloaded at runtime. The Drone offers out-of-the-box integration with multiple source code management systems. It supports integration with SCM systems such as GitHub, GitHubEnterprise, Bitbucket, and GitLab. This **freeware software deployment tool** supports plugins for performing a wide range of tasks. Plugins are like Docker containers and do certain jobs such as deploy code, publish artifacts, send the notification. Developers can write the plugin in any language and publish it as a Docker image. The Drone is written in Go language. This **open source deployment tool** is released under the Apache License.
