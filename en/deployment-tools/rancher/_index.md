Rancher is an open-source **container management platform**. It is 100% free and fully supported by an active community. It offers a complete set of infrastructure services for containers, networking, storage services, host management, and load balancing. Software teams can easily deploy and manage containerized applications by using a powerful **container management tool**.

Rancher comes with excellent features such as container load balancing, persistent storage services, resource management, Multi-tenancy, user management, multi orchestration engines, and many more. Rancher allows teams to define configurations for new clusters or import existing clusters. Further, Rancher builds and scales Kubernetes on any infrastructure using RKE (Rancher Kubernetes Engine). Rancher comes with a beautiful UI that allows teams to deploy workloads, export configuration files, and troubleshoot existing deployments. In addition, **docker container management** software allows DevOps teams to manage workloads either using the API or KubeCTL CLI.

This **container management system** supports Rancher integration with a wide range of popular services for container operations such as Aqua, GitLab, Sysdig, Datadog, Artifactory, Portworx, and Calico. Rancher is written in Go &amp; Python languages, and source code is available at GitHub. The license for this open-source **container management platform** is Apache-2.0.
