### **Overview**

Jenkins is one of the leading **open source automation server**. It is a 100% **free deployment tool** that supports (CI) continuous integration and (CD) continuous deployment features. **Jenkins open source** server comes with a wide range of plugins for building, deploying, and automating software. It is a robust, reliable, and extensible deployment tool. Jenkins uses Master-Slave architecture. This allows software teams to run multiple builds and tests for software simultaneously.

**Jenkins automation server** has a highly secured mechanism to ensure that users can protect their automation infrastructure accurately. User access control is the key component of Jenkins that supports authentication and authorization schemes. Moreover, access control can be extended by installing third-party plugins. Pipeline support is another wonderful feature. The Pipeline is a collection of plugins that allows continuous delivery pipelines to be incorporated and integrated into Jenkins. The pipeline generates code, performs tests, and deploys a new version of the application securely.

This **open source deployment tool** is written in Java. Jenkins has detailed documentation for administrators, developers, and end-users. Moreover, the source code of this **free deployment tool** is available on GitHub and release with MIT License.
