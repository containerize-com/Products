### **Requirements**
------------

1. Hugo runs on a standard version of all major desktop operating systems - Windows, MacOS and the various flavors of Unix.
2. You need to have Go installed to use Hugo modules. If you plan to not use Hugo modules and manually place the theme in the themes folder of the website, then Go installation is not required. If Hugo isd installed via the package manager, the package manager takes care of installing the Go Language. The installation instruction for Go are present at golang.org/doc/install. You do not need to learn Go or use it directly within Hugo.
3. While git is not required to use Hugo, if git is used as a version control system, Hugo provides access to the metadata in the templates. Git is available in all package managers as git. You can also get git from git-scm.com/. You can learn more about git from Git in Practice and Learn Git in a Month of Lunches.
