### Installation Guide
------------------

 ```
 sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev 
```

It is best to avoid installing Ruby Gems as the root user. Therefore, we need to set up a gem installation directory for your user account. The following commands will add environment variables to your `~/.bashrc` file to configure the gem installation path. Run them now:

 ```
 
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc 
```

Finally, install Jekyll:

 ```
gem install jekyll bundler 
```

**That's it! Congrats Jekyll is install now**
