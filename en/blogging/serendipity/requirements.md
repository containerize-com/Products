### Requirements
------------

You need a PHP installation (PHP 7.0 or newer) together with MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite . We also require the Apache webserver, because we utilize a number of internal functions to make Serendipity run correctly. To fully enjoy serendipity, you should have either ImageMagickâ€™s convert binary installed on your server or a PHP installation with gd2 support (recommended).
