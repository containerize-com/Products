#### Overview

Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub where users can follow friends and discover new ones. On Mastodon, users can publish small updates to a stream of updates like posts, links, pictures, text, video. All Mastodon servers are interoperable as a federated network where users on one server can communicate with users from another one and discover new ones.

Mastodon is a Ruby on Rails application with a React.js front-end licensed under AGPLv3. It follows standard practices of those frameworks, so if you are already familiar with Rails or React.js, you will not find any surprises here. The best way of working with Mastodon in a development environment is installing all the dependencies on your system, rather than using Docker or Vagrant. You need Ruby, Node.js, PostgreSQL and Redis, which is a pretty standard set of dependencies for Rails applications.
