### **Overview**

Metasploit is an open source network security application. Metasploit helps security teams do more than just verify vulnerabilities, manage security assessments and improve security awareness with collaboration between the open source community and Rapid7. It allows shared sessions, data and communication through a single metasploit instance. The Metasploit framework is a computer security project being used by cybercriminals as well as ethical hackers to show systematic flaws and vulnerabilities on networks at any point along the production and deployment process. You don't have to install metasploit in kali linux as kali linux penetration testing tool is built-in.

Metasploit is the worldâ€™s most used modular penetration testing framework and the powerful browser exploitation framework. Metasploit penetration testing is hacking with permission and is one of the most commonly used penetration testing framework. Open source metasploit framework 5.0 improves security testing and penetration testing techniques. It is made up of a suite of tools that helps you test your network security vulnerabilities, simulate attacks and escape detections. Metasploit has many different settings to evade an IDS/IPS, intrusion detection system and intrusion prevention system. Because it's an open-source framework so it can be easily customized and used with most operating systems for vulnerability assessment and penetration testing. Metasploit penetration testing framework has 24.1K GitHub stars and 11.3K GitHub forks.
