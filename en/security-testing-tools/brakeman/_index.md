Brakeman is a open source static code analysis tool to check Ruby on Rails applications for security vulnerabilities. It comes as an open source project with optional commercial support for vulnerability detection in Rails applications. Brakeman static analysis tool scans for known insecure patterns and configurations in your source code before the code reaches production. It is the most comprehensive security scanner that provides an easy to read vulnerability assessment report and reports can be generated while building or deploying an app to sandbox or production environments. Brakeman can also be used for Sinatra and any other kind of rack application to find security issues.

Brakeman static code analysis security tool separates issues in different high, medium and weak levels. It scans all files in source code of an application to find potential security vulnerabilities at any stage of development. Every time new code changes are committed to the code repository, the brakeman source code scanner runs to check for security vulnerabilities by performing a static analysis of the code. This tool will catch many known vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Command injection, Cross Site Scripting and more. Brakeman is an open source source code analysis tool with 6.1K GitHub stars and 652 GitHub forks.
