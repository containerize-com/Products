### **Overview**

Browser Exploitation Framework BeEF is a powerful vulnerability and penetration testing tool. It is an open source security project for penetration testing, focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in the web browsers. It can be used to further exploit a cross site scripting (XSS) flaw in a web application. BeEF penetration testing framework is not a tool explicitly for Rails testing like Brakeman but it can be very useful in getting a better idea of threats to a web application. The framework contains modules that employ BeEF's simple and powerful API. BeEF API is at the heart of the framework efficiency and effectiveness. This tool was developed solely for penetration testing.

BeEF server communicates with the hooked browser through a web based user interface. BeEF browser exploitation framework comes with the Kali Linux and it is used by penetration testers to assess the actual security of a system by focusing on the web browser. This makes the tool different to many other tools, as it examines exploitability within the context of the web browser. BeEF kali linux penetration testing software uses numerous command modules from within the web browser to perform requested attacks against the system. Beefproject penetration testing framework has 5.8K GitHub stars and 1.4K GitHub forks.
