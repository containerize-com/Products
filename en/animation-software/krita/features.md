#### **Features**

Here are some good to know features about this open source animation software:

- Kritaâ€™s animation tools are designed for frame to frame raster animation with realtime animation playback controls to edit and review animations. 
- If you require assistance as a new animator, Krita also provides drawing assistants that help with drawing straight lines, vanishing points, drawing ellipses, and other outlines as well. There are more than 9 different drawing assistants to choose from.
- Onion skinning is a useful animation technique to edit cartoons or sketches frame by frame, in sequence for better understanding of which frames need changes. Krita provides customizable onion skinning that reduces the effort and time put in using traditional animation techniques.
- Krita provides animators and digital painters with more than 100 brushes to choose from so that each animation that you create has a unique effect and is true to your vision.
- Painting on a canvas is different as compared digitally painting, and while mastering a brush through a peripheral device may take time, Krita provides the ability to stabilize brush strokes for smooth, straight, curved lines. There is even a dedicated Dynamic Brush tool that aids in this particular issue.
- With built in vector tools you can also add texts on your animations through Krita. It uses SVG to manage the vector formatted outputs.
- As an open source painting animation software, not only can you import brush and texture packages created by Krita users, but you can also use the source code to create your own and share them with everyone as well.
