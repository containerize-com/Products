#### **Features**

Here are some good to know features about this open source animation software:

- You can use K-3D to create animation files that use OpenGL solid, shaded or texture mapped views and can be edited at any time. 
- There are many interactive tutorials and macros available to use K-3D which you can record and share with the community or playback for yourself.
- For maximum productivity K-3D allows you to playback animation at any time during the modelling, editing or animating part of a task.
- K-3D provides many viewing angles that let you pan, tilt, zoom in or out, or view animation in dolly, tripod or modelling modes.
- One of the best features of K-3D includes the establishing of connection between arbitrary data in the visualization pipeline. You can connect any object property with another one to create complex and unique pipelines.
- K-3D provides many basic and advanced animation features such as Bezier curve, animate different modelling operations, apply different textures with a 16-bit float bitdepth and more.
- Rendering is pretty powerful for K-3D as it includes industrial strength standards as its foundation with the inclusion of native RenderMan â„¢ support including Aqsis, Pixie, Render Dot c and more.
- You can also create 2D compositions instead of 3D animation. Some of the 3D primitives include cone, circle, disk, cylinder, as well as geometry types like Polygon, NURBS, blobby and more.
- K-3D is a free 3d modeling software for beginners. New artists will find K-3D easy to understand, and professionals feel right at home.
