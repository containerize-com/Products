#### **Features**

Here are some good to know features about this open source animation software:

- Opentoonz can be used to create animations with multiple effects using the SDK plugin provided by the developers. You can change picture styles by overlapping images to create a new image.
- The animation application allows you to change the incident light on your animations by using the Affected Incident Light Effect.
- Animators can also create a wavy distortion animation for a more detailed 2D animation. 
- As Opentoonz is open source, it allows you to create new function to meet the on-site demands of any commercial project. The GTS scanning tool was created by Studio Ghibli to bridge the gap between scanning different colored scans without any issue. 
- Opentoonz has its application in different animation projects for commercial use, school events, professional production, amateur production and more.
