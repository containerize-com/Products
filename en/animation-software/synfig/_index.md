Synfig is an open source animation software that uses a “tweenless” animation system that is designed to speed up the animation process instead of adding more load to the illustration process where animators have to draw every frame. With Synfig you a combined front-end and back-end application to design and render animations, whether on the same computer or not.

As an open source animation creater software, Synfig relies on less resources and plugins to create high quality animations by offering popular effects such as simulating soft shading using curved gradients. This not only saves time, but reduces the effort an animator has to put in by adding shading in every frame. Similarly, as an open source application, Synfig provides two binary builds for animators that wish for more control, stability or the latest features.

This free 2D animation software is compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac OS, and requires at least 2GB RAM or more, as well as, a Dual Core CPU at 2 GHZ or more. Furthermore, Synfig has been used to animate many popular projects such as Morevna: Demo Project, the Polar Detective Prologue by Cyan Los, The Deadline by Morevna School and more.
