Features
--------

Here are some good to know features about the open source animation software application, Synfig:

- Synfig provides animators full control of designing and rendering artwork with vector based tweening.
- You can also apply real time effects in layers or groups of layers such as radial blurs, tweaking colors resolutions, gradients, filters, distortion, transformations and more. 
- Synfig also provides a full bone system whereby animators can create cutout animations using bitmap images, add skeleton distortion layers to apply complex deformation to bitmap artwork and more.
- With powerful and advanced controls, you link and add parameters of various layers through mathematical expressions or directly. This way animators can create advanced character puppets and similar dynamic structures within their animations.
- As an open source animation tool, Synfig stores all information such as vector graphic data, embed reference to external bitmap images, and revision history of the project as well.
- One of the best features of Synfig is its time effective alternative to manual tweening which reduces effort animators have to put in when applying color shading to every frame to speed up the rendering process.
