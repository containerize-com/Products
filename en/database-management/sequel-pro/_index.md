Sequel Pro is an open-source and 100% free database management application to work with MySQL &amp; MariaDB databases on MacOS. The application is developed in Objective-C and is highly customizable. Anyone can download the source code from Github and enhance its features as per their needs.

One of the reasons for its popularity is its simple and beautiful interface. Helps beginners to access MySQL databases on local and remote servers without any trouble. As a scalable solution, any size business enterprise can use Sequel Pro to meet their database management needs.

Compared to web-based MySQL database management tools that rely on username/password login like phpMyAdmin, Sequel Pro’s support for the SSH Keys gives it prominence over other tools. It has built-in Backup and Restore functionality. Gives you a beautiful interface to monitor your running queries. Sequel Pro for Mac gave a tough competition to the official MySQL workbench for Mac.

Even though it’s very popular on the Mac platform, sequel pro for windows is not yet available. If you are a mac user and want to use an easy and beautiful database management tool then Sequel Pro is for you.
