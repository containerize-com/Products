Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) tool is aimed to help you find forensic traces to understand whether the Pegasus spyware has targeted your phone. Pegasus spyware from Israel-based NSO Group was found to have allegedly helped governments in countries, including India, to hack into the phones of thousands of activists, journalists, and politicians. An international consortium of news outlets revealed some details of the targets in the last couple of days. However, the scope of targeted attacks through Pegasus is yet to be defined.

Amnesty International Security Lab researchers developed MVT tool in July 2021 to let you see whether your phone is targeted by the spyware. It is called Mobile Verification Toolkit or MVT and pegasus spyware signs can be detected on your smartphones using this dedicated tool. This tool is aimed to help you identify if the Pegasus spyware has targeted your phone. It works with both Android and iOS devices, though the researchers noted that it is easier to find the signs of compromise on iPhone handsets over an Android device due to more forensic traces available on the Apple hardware. MVT open source software has 5.1K GitHub stars and 383 GitHub forks.
