Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) software is used to help you check forensic traces to understand whether your iphone or android phone have been compromised by the pegasus israeli spyware. Pegasus spyware founded in 2010 by Israeli pegasus nso group technologies, enables the remote surveillance of cellphone devices. Pegasus spyware has allegedly helped governments in countries like India, to hack into the smartphones of thousands of human rights activists, journalists and politicians worldwide. According to The Washington Post, Pegasus israeli spyware attack include 189 journalists, at least 65 business executives, more than 600 politicians and government officials, 85 activists of human rights and several heads of state.

Amnesty International Security Lab performed in depth forensic analysis of smartphone devices and researchers developed MVT tool in July 2021 to let you check whether your mobile is targeted by the nso group pegasus spyware. Israeli pegasus spyware signs can be detected on your cellphones using this dedicated tool called Mobile Verification Toolkit or MVT. This digital forensics tool is aimed to help you identify if the pegasus israel spyware has infected your phone including discovering pegasus network injection attacks. MVT open source forensic tool works with both Android and iOS devices but researchers discovered that it is easier to find the signs of compromise on iphone handsets than android devices due to more forensic traces available on the apple hardware. MVT open source forensic software has 5.6K GitHub stars and 436 GitHub forks.
