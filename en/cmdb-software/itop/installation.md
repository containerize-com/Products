### **Installation**

once all the pre-requisites are installed, visit this [configuration](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/page?id=latest%3Ainstall%3Aphp_and_mysql_configuration) page.

After that, run the following command to clone the source code:

 ```
git clone https://github.com/Combodo/iTop.git
```
Then, make sure that you have a properly configured instance of Apache/PHP running.

Now, unpack the content of the “web” directory in a directory served by your web server (for example /var/www/html/itop on Linux or C:\inetpub\wwwroot\itop on Windows/IIS).

Finally, open the URL corresponding to the directory where the files have been unpacked (for example http://localhost/itop) and follow the installation instructions.
