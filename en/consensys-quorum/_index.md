ConsenSys Quorum is a free open source DLT platform. It is self-hosted and offers many features to build blockchain-based enterprise solutions. However, users can build a public network or private permissioned network on their own premises. Above all, security standards are high to protect data in the private network. Moreover, this free software is highly extensible and developers familiar with Entereum’s tools and environment can find ease in working with it. There are multiple consensus algorithms such as Raft-based Consensus, Istanbul BFT, and Clique POA Consensus. 

In addition, this open source distributed ledger network offers a complete echo system to build plugins for needed functionalities. Further, there are features to monitor running applications and backups for databases. The ConsenSys Quorum community has developed many tools and libraries such as Quorum Blockchain Explorer, Quorum-Genesis, and more. 

This DLT platform is written in Go language with a little input of other languages such as JavaScript, C, and Solidity. It is easy to set up either on-premises or on the cloud. Therefore, comprehensive documentation regarding deployment and development is available of this decentralized ledger.
