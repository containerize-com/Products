Here are some good to know features of GIMP:

- When it comes to photo enhancement features, GIMP allows users to fix any imperfections they find in their images with different fixes for faults like Perspective distortion, Barrel distortion etc.
- With GIMP you can easily correct the color saturation, brightness, contrast and more, while activating the Corrective mode or fixing a photo’s color composition by applying the Vignette filter.
- One of the main features of GIMP is its ability to digitally retouch images by removing any unnecessary details with tools such as Clone and Heal.
- GIMP provides support for many input devices such as USBs, tablets, MIDI controllers and more. It also allows you to bind commonly used GIMP interface actions with device events such as moving a MIDI controller’s slider or rotating a USB wheel. This way you can speed up and automate your workflow.
- You can also produce many graphic design assets such as logos for brands, mockups for mobile apps, user interface for websites and more.
- GIMP provides parametric brushes for digitally painting images and allows the use of 3rd party plugins as well.
