As free and open source photo editor, the GNU Image Manipulation Program aka GIMP is a useful and powerful tool for photo manipulation and editing. Not only is it compatible with multiple languages like Python, C++, Perl, Scheme and more but you can also integrate into your photography workflow alongside other applications like Scribus, Inkscape and SwatchBooker.

Furthermore, as a free image editing software, GIMP allows developers to extend the capability and usability of the image editor with third party plugins and customizing scripts for further use. One of the main features of GIMP is its virtual file system that allows users to load and save files from different remote locations using HTPP, FTP, and SMB protocols.

GIMP has a customizable interface that is easy to understand and navigate, while providing versatile image manipulation features. With GIMP photo retouching, image composition and authoring becomes simple and easy to accomplish, however in order to use the open source image editor you can download it on Windows, Mac OS, Linux and GNU.
