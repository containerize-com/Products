--------

Some of the main features of the open source, image processor Photivo are:

- Photivo provides many image processing and manipulation features like correcting chromatic aberration, bad pixel reduction, line denoise, median filter, wavelet denoise and much more.
- With the help of Photivo you can easily tilt, shift or apply a toy effect, and apply black and white conversion as well.
- Some other effects that you can apply on raw images with Photivo include film grain simulation, adaptive saturation, local contrast filters such as texture contrast, HiRaLoAm, as well as sharpening images.
- Photivo has a 16 bit internal processing which allows for bitmap files in 8 bit format to be saved and processed in 16 bit which provides better quality resolution.
- You can also directly save and export your images to GIMP for further editing after the integration has been completed.
- Photivo also provides many color coded status indicators for the tools in the interface so that developers are aware which tools are being currently active and applied on images.
- The image editor is available in multiple languages including Dutch, German, Italian and Russian.
