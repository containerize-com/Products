#### **Installation Instructions**

Firstly, visit this [link](https://www.solismed.com/startup.html) and download the source code available under the "Do It Yourself" section.

However, the installation process of Solismed is similar to WordPress.

Secondly, for localhost, copy the system files to the main folder or a subfolder inside your localhost and create MYSQL database by using phpMyAdmin. The database connection information is stored in the following file.

    /config/$ettings.php

Thirdly, open the following address in your browser and follow the setup instructions.

    https://www.mysite.com/foldername

Finally, a login page will appear after setup is completed. You can use the system admin’s password (used during the installation process) as the password for any example staff and patient. The username will be their first name.
