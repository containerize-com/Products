### **Overview**
The latest updates are evolving the technology at a high pace and hence, vulnerabilities are also increasing in almost every area of an online business. Authorization and Authentication layer is one of those areas which are hotspot in terms of attacks and loop wholes. To address these sensitivities, there are many open source software developed to provide better-centralized sing in / sign out mechanisms, password management and security.

Here comes Authelia, It is a freeware written in Go language along with TypeScript and little input of some other languages like JavaScript and HTML. Authelia provides an intuitive user interface to allow users to log in and access all the resources. It offers two factor authentication by employing time based OTP generated by Google Authenticator.

As far as the workflow of Authelia is concerned, it works in collaboration with reverse proxies such as Nginx. Whenever there is an incoming request, the proxy server forwards that request to the Authelia, Authelia then decides either to allow the incoming request or block. It works for sites served over HTTPS and also supports the user databases like LDAP and Active Directory.
