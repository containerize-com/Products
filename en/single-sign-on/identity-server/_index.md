IdentityServer is a open source framework that uses openid connect and oauth 2.0 to achieve single sign on, acts as a single authentication and authorization server for multiple applications.

IdentityServer supports both full .NET framework (4.5.x) and .NET Core (which is cross platform). IdentityServer 4 takes the benefits of .NET Core and can be deployed using docker on linux systems.

It follows Open ID Connect and OAuth 2.0 specifications and supports wide range of clients like mobile, web and SPAs. Itâ€™s database agnostic so you can use any back-end of your choice. It acts as a Authentication server which will allow users to sign in and provides a JWT bearer token that can be used to access protected resources from a SPA or mobile app. It can be used to provide authentication for multi-tenant apps, hosted on separate domains. It achieves app sso using OIDC (which is an authentication layer on top of OAuth2).
