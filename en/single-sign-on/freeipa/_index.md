FreeIPA is a free open source authentication and authorization solution for Linux/UNIX based networked systems. It consists of some powerful components such as Directory Server, Kerberos, PKI, DNS, Certmonger, NTP Server, Web UI, Trusts, and Client. Further, this open source software provides single sign-on capabilities for servers and applications in the network. It is highly configurable with other software such as Microsoft Active Directory. Additionally, it offers automation of installation and ease of management tasks.

This free SSO software comes up with multiple user interfaces such as Web UI, CLI, and JSONRPC API. Moreover, the FreeIPA Directory Service is based on LDAP and it acts as a backend for authorization and authentication. Above all, the integrated PKI signs and publishes certificates for FreeIPA hosts and services. After that, administrators can manage and serve DNS records using DNS integration.

FreeIPA is mainly written in Python with the input of other languages such as JavaScript and C with documentation regarding deployment and development.
