### **Overview**

Ripple is an open source digital currency and payment solution. It provides ways for the fast and secured transaction of payment within its network. There are three roles that a Ripple node can take. Firstly, it can act as a normal user who transfers or receives payments. Secondly, the market maker can be a trade enabler in the system. Thirdly, the validating server usually validates transactions and runs a consensus protocol in this distributed infrastructure.

It is an open source distributed payment system based on the XRP ledger that is a decentralized cryptographic ledger and it is powered by servers connected peer to peer. Consensus protocol which runs over the validating servers is an asynchronous round-based protocol. However, this distributed digital ledger has three phases the collection phase, consensus phase, and ledger closing phase.

Moreover, the security of this digital ledger technology depends upon ECDSA signatures. In addition, this digital financial technology is fast as there is a quick transaction validation mechanism in Rippleâ€™s network. It is an open network so all the transactions are publicly available.

This open source distributed infrastructure is written in C++, Objective C, and a little input of some other languages. Further, anyone can deploy the instance of this distributed payment system. This decentralized platform has 0% failure as mentioned in their documentation.
