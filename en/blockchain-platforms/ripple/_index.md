Ripple is an open source digital currency and payment solution. It provides ways for the fast and secured transaction of payment within its network. There are three roles that a Ripple node can take. Firstly, it can act as a normal user who transfers or receives payments. Secondly, the market maker can be a trade enabler in the system. Thirdly, the validating server usually validates transactions and runs a consensus protocol.

It is an open source distributed payment system is based on the XRP ledger that is a decentralized cryptographic ledger and it is powered by servers that are connected peer to peer. Consensus protocol which runs over the validating servers is an asynchronous round-based protocol. However, it has three phases the collection phase, consensus phase, and ledger closing phase.

Moreover, the security of Ripple depends upon ECDSA signatures. In addition, this digital financial technology is fast as there is a quick transaction validation mechanism in Rippleâ€™s network. It is an open network so all the transactions are publicly available.

This open source decentralized platform is written in C++, Objective C, and a little input of some other languages. Further, anyone can deploy the instance of this distributed payment system. It has 0% failure as mentioned in their documentation.
