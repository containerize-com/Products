Multichain is an open source decentralized ledger technology for building blockchain applications. It is robust, provides provisions to track and verify assets over the network. Users can create multiple key-value databases on the blockchain. Further, users can control all the operations such as who can send and receive transactions, streams, connect, create assets, and blocks. In addition, there are eight types of permissions in this software and all permissions are assigned on a per-address basis. It lets you create multi-stage assets and metadata in several stages.

This enterprise digital asset management software provides you the facility to perform transactions securely. Above all, the MultiChain node’s wallet performs external key management. Then, multi-signature is the prominent feature of this open source software where it secures digital transaction management with multiple users’ keys. Moreover, it provides development tools such as MultiChain Explorer, MultiChain Web Demo, Docker-multichain, and YobiChain.

This decentralized ledger technology is written in C++ and all relevant documentation is available. It can be deployed on all popular platforms such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. Furthermore, there are many MultiChain wrapper libraries written in multiple languages.
