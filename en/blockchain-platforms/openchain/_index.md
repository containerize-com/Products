Openchain is a free and open source Blockchain based software. It is highly scalable and extensible. This software is based on client server architecture that is well known due to efficiency. It is robust, self hosted, and offers secure ways to manage digital assets. However, anyone can set up its instance and control digitally signed transactions. It provides instance level authority to validate the transactions. Moreover, instances are configurable with one another through HTTP based API’s. Similarly, there are administrators on every Openchain instance who define and enforce the rules of exchanging digital assets.

This distributed ledger technology has no mining mechanism rather instance admins verify the transactions. Therefore, there is no fee associated with transactions. In addition, Wallet apps connect to validators via API’s to records digital transactions. Above all, Openchain does not store transactions in blocks rather transactions are directly linked with one another. Then, it uses the consensus algorithm named Partionned Consensus.

This open source software is written in C#. Further, there is comprehensive documentation available regarding development and deployment.
