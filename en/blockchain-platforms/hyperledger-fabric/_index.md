### **Overview**

Hyperledger Fabric is an open source digital asset management platform to build decentralized apps. It is backed by Linux Foundation and has a very strong developer community. Its architecture is modular that makes its echo system completely configurable. This open source permissioned distributed ledger provides solutions to many business use cases such as banking, healthcare, finance, human resource, and more. One of the finest things is that developers can write the smart contract in any general-purpose programming language such as Nodejs, Java, Go.

Most of the time Blockchain is a public network. However, Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned Blockchain in which every participant is known to one another. Above all, this open source ledger technology comes up with pluggable consensus protocols which mean users can use the consensus protocol depending upon the use case. Therefore, all these features make this decentralized ledger technology highly secure where transactions take place in a fully private mode.

This permissioned Blockchain is written in Go language and its source code is available with comprehensive documentation. Further. this digital asset management platform is highly scalable and provides many other features that include governance and versioning of smart contracts, designed for continuous operations, queryable data. Moreover, its modular architecture allows the configurations with third party software such as LDAP, OpenID Connect, and cryptographic libraries.
