#### **Installation Instructions**

Once the pre-requisites are installed, run the following command to download the source files:

 ```
<pre data-title="Preformatted">```
git clone https://github.com/Countly/countly-server.git<br></br>
```
```

Extract the Countly package to the directory of your taste (e.g. under /usr) – **do not use the** /root folder for this purpose. Then, fire the easy installation script that comes with Countly, which will work for both Ubuntu and RHEL/CentOS:

 ```
<pre data-title="Preformatted">```
sudo su –<br></br>cd COUNTLY_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY/bin
```
```

Then, run the following command:

 ```
<pre data-title="Preformatted">```
bash countly.install.sh
```
```

Installation may take between 10-15 minutes. Finally, access your application into the browser at the following link:

 ```
<pre data-title="Preformatted">```
http://your_server_ip_or_domain/
```
```
