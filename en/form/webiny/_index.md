Webiny is a self-hosted open source platform developed to meet most of the serverless business use cases. It is a complete package to automate most of the online business processes which includes an enterprise form builder to build and deploy forms. It is developed using the most advanced technologies like GraphQL, Nodejs as the server side environment and Reactjs for the front end.

Rapid application development is the need of the time. However, Webiny provides CLI to set-up and bootstrap the project locally as well as to deploy on the cloud. Webiny supports the scaffolding options to speed up the development processes like creating services, schema and comes with built-in Apollo Gateway integration.

Being a serverless environment, Webiny offers unlimited scalability provisions to eliminate the issues related to load balancing and it all happens automatically with the help of defined services.

Data security is the most critical aspect when it comes to the integration with the third party resources. Webiny introduces token based mechanisms in which API issues tokens for the users to consume the third party integrations within the application.

Along with many other options, Form builder at Webiny offers custom validation rules on the form fields, multi language support, provision to preview the form before publishing and built-in support for reCAPTCHA.
