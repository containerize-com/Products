**System Requirements**
-----------------------

For ShareTribe production installation Iâ€™d recommend that you go with Heroku. That way you get easily the scalability when needed, as well as handling of database e.g. Thinking-sphinx addon for indexing and searching. Of course, you can go with AWS directly and it requires following dependencies.

- Ruby 2.6
- Ruby on Rails 5.2.3
- MySQL 5.7
- Node.js 10.15 to compile JavaScript asset pipeline
- React + jQuery
- Deploy: Custom Deployment Script
- Server: Heroku OR AWS
- Image hosting: Amazon S3
- Background job: delayed\_job
- RubyGems: Installation as dependency
- Editor: Sublime Text or RubyMine
- Imagemagick
- Git
