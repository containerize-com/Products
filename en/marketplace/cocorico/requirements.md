**System Requirements**
-----------------------

For cocorico production installation, Iâ€™d recommend that you go with AWS. You can go with AWS directly and Cocorico requires following installation dependencies.

- PHP 7.1
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- PHP MongoDB Driver
- Apache 2 or Nginx
- AWS t3a.small instance
- Sublime Text or Komodo editor
- Git
