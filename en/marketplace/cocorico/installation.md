### Installation Instructions to setup the production environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Installation on Ubuntu

Install and configure the necessary dependencies packages. Fork Cocorico git repository then get sources. Go to to your parent 'Document Root' directory and clone repository:

 ```
cd /var/www/cocorico.dev/
git clone https://github.com/Cocolabs-SAS/cocorico.git Symfony
```

Create services Google API, microsoft Translator and Facebook Login App accounts by following guides from here:

 ```
https://console.developers.google.com/project
https://www.microsoft.com/translator/getstarted.aspx. 
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register
```

Now install composer. If you don't have Composer yet, run the following command in the root folder of your Symfony project:

 ```
cd Symfony
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Install Cocorico dependencies and below command will ask you the values of some of your application parameters:

 ```
php composer.phar install --prefer-dist -vvv
```

Set your application parameters:

 ```
app/config/parameters.yml.dist
```

Configure environment defaults. Copy and paste web/.htaccess.dist and rename it to web/.htaccess. Initialize the SQL and NoSQL MongoDB database:

 ```
chmod 744 bin/init-db
./bin/init-db php --env=dev
chmod 744 bin/init-mongodb
./bin/init-mongodb php --env=dev
```

Before starting coding, execute this script to make sure that your local system is properly configured for Cocorico:

 ```
php bin/symfony_requirements
```

The script returns a status code of 0 if all mandatory requirements are met, 1 otherwise. Access the config.php script from a browser: http://localhost:8080/config.php If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on. Now check security dependencies:

 ```
bin/security-checker security:check composer.lock
```

In case of error "An error occurred: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate, run below

 ```
bin/security-checker security:check --end-point=http://security.sensiolabs.org/check_lock composer.lock
```

Dump the assets

 ```
php bin/console assets:install --symlink web --env=dev
php bin/console assetic:dump --env=dev
```

You need to configure a couple Cron jobs in order to properly run your marketplace in production. See the [Crons documentation](https://github.com/Cocolabs-SAS/cocorico/blob/master/doc/crons.md). You can read about Cocorico features in more detail on the platformâ€™s site, but the idea here is that Cocorico has everything our clients typically ask for.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Cocorico marketplace. Enjoy!
