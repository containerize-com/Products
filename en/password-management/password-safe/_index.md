### **Overview**

Open-source password managers are a great option when it comes to making sure that your passwords are not only stored in one place but won’t fall in the wrong hands either. Password Safe is a good contender as an easy-to-use and free to download credentials management software. It was built upon Bruce Scheiner’s Blowfish encryption algorithm that uses the same key to decrypt and encrypt a message. It is one of the best free password vaults as well as a safe password manager.

Password Safe was solely developed for Windows and Linux users. However, you can find clones of the software for other operating systems and platforms as well. As a free to download password manager, Password Safe was further improved to keep your passwords secure by including encryption algorithm TwoFish and using cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 to generate keys.

While Password Safe has many features that are similar to other open source password managers, it’s easy to use interface makes it quite popular among users with little to no technical background. With Password Safe users can store all sorts of information from bank and credit card information, email accounts, emergency numbers and passwords as well. However, Password Safe doesn’t have any browser extensions currently, that can be used to auto-fill passwords on different websites.
