### **Overview**

Credential management apps are a convenient way of storing your passwords for different accounts and websites at one place. Especially if you use complex password combinations consisting of alphanumeric and special characters, then it can be hard remembering them all. KeePass is an open source password manager which makes it simple and easy for users to store and manage their usernames and passwords. You just need to remember one master password to login into any app. It is one of the best free password manager software.

KeePass makes it easier for users to access passwords by syncing them on multiple devices or sharing files on Dropbox, OneDrive, or other file sharing apps. While KeePass is developed mainly as a password manager for Windows OS, you can still run the password manager on Max or Linux as well. All passwords are stored in one database which is encrypted with a master key that is shared with the user. When it comes to encryption KeePass uses SHA-256, TwoFish, and other popular encryption algorithms to ensure the safety and security of passwords.
