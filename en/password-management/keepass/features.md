When using a password manager security is of the utmost importance. KeePass not only uses end to end encryption but stores all passwords at the client-side in an encrypted file. Only the owner of these passwords can decrypt it with the master key.

The passwords are stored in a .kbdx file that is encrypted using AES-256 algorithm with the master key to the file generated through a hash function SHA-256 which makes it almost impossible for a hacker to gain access.

- **Open source**
 
As an open source password manager it is free to use and developers can have access to the source code. This allows a layer of transparency for technical users to verify how safe and efficient the security measures have been implemented by KeePass.

- **Cross platform sync**
 
As the passwords are stored in a secure .kbdx files you can easily upload the file to different cloud applications like Google Drive, Dropbox, or carry the passwords with you on a USB.
