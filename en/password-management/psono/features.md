Here are some good to know features about Psono:

- Psono uses a multilayered encryption where three layers of encryption protect the data when it is being transferred from a browser to the Psono application server. The server encrypts the data using Salso20 stream cipher along with the Poly1305 MAC code that reduces the necessity of relying on the DBA (data base administrator) for validation.
- You can use the Password Generator to produce a password consisting of a minimum of 6 characters or more consisting of symbols, numbers, lower case/upper case characters etc.
- With Psono you can easily autofill your login credentials for different websites after providing the necessary details on the application.
- Passwords can also be accessed when you are offline through the client side applications.
- You can also create emergency codes to access passwords in case of a digital legacy problem such as the passing away of a team member or unavailability in case of an emergency.
- Psono also detects any password breach that may have happened and reports on it in time.
- You will find multiple API keys that allow for the integration of password during builds or startup scripts.
