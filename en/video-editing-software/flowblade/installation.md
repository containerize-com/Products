#### **Installation Instructions**

Flowblade is a script application. However, it can be launched without compiling anything.

Once pre-requisites are installed, run the following command to clone the source code:

 ```
<pre class="block-editor-rich-text__editable wp-block-preformatted block-editor-block-list__block wp-block is-selected is-hovered rich-text" contenteditable="true" data-block="03932bac-181f-4eeb-a9c7-7ee7022dba17" data-title="Preformatted" data-type="core/preformatted" id="block-03932bac-181f-4eeb-a9c7-7ee7022dba17" tabindex="0">```
git clone https://github.com/jliljebl/flowblade.git
```
```

Now, install the dependencies from this [link](https://github.com/jliljebl/flowblade/blob/master/flowblade-trunk/docs/DEPENDENCIES.md).

Then, go into the cloned directory by running the following command.

 ```
cd flowblade-trunk<br></br>
```

Finally, launch the application by running the following command:

 ```
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">```
./flowblade
```
```
