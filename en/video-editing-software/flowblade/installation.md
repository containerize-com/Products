#### **Installation Instructions**

Flowblade is a script application. However, it can be launched without compiling anything.

Once pre-requisites are installed, run the following command to clone the source code:

Now, install the dependencies from this [link](https://github.com/jliljebl/flowblade/blob/master/flowblade-trunk/docs/DEPENDENCIES.md).

Then, go into the cloned directory by running the following command.

    cd flowblade-trunk

Finally, launch the application by running the following command:

    ./flowblade
