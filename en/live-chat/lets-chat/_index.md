Let’s Chat is an open source live chat software for small teams. This live chat software is designed to be easily deployable and solve the common communication problems of small and medium teams.

Let’s Chat is a low profile live chat software in comparison with the available alternatives like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zulip and Rocket.Chat. This live chat app runs in the browser and support BYOS (bring your own server).
