### **Overview**

Using a secure texting app like Signal is a good idea for talking as the primary use of a phone. It is a lot easier to store and work with plain text than it is to do with audio. Signal is a trusted private messaging application and its simplicity allows you to seamlessly continue conversations back and forth between your mobile device and your desktop computer. Everything is end-to-end encrypted in order to keep your communication safe. It allows you to send high-quality private group, text, pictures, and video messages for free.

Signal desktop app is a bit more limited than the phone app. Signal Desktop is a Chrome app which links with your phone, so that all incoming and outgoing conversations are displayed consistently across all your devices. So, your contacts don’t have to guess where to message you. Signal code is free, open source, and available on GitHub. This allows experts to verify our protocols and implementations. Signal Desktop contains no advertisements and it is a secure messaging app for Android, iPhone, and desktop. Like other messaging apps, Signal can be used for texting, voice, and video calls etc. Signal supports every emoji like people, animals, food, objects and flags, etc.
