There are lots of Mail Servers available online like Postal Mail, Squirrel Mail, Scalix but what makes Cuttlefish distinctive is its beautiful web interface which makes it very easy to use and monitor whats happening under the hood.

Cuttlefish supports SMTP protocol which helps you send email from your application with no effort, it helps you monitor in real time which emails are reaching at their destination and which are bouncing back. It also supports tracking of email like which one is opened and which links are clicked.

Another distinctive feature of Cuttlefish is that you can check your IP reputation with one click. Cuttlefish doesnâ€™t support HTTP API yet but the development team has it on the cards and already working on it. So very soon we can expect it be available which will make it a better alternative to SendGrid and Mailgun.

Cuttlefish uses postfix for email delivery which is one of the most popular and reliable open source mail transfer agent that routes and delivers electronic mail.
