### Features

The following is a list of major Postfix features. Some features require third-party libraries (examples: LDAP, SQL, TLS). Other features are available only when the necessary operating system support exists and Postfix knows how to use it (examples: IP version 6, connection caching).

*   Logging to logfile
*   Junk mail controls
*   Maildir and mailbox format
*   Multiple Database support
