Communication via electronic mail has become primitive in our lives. To send emails from desktop, mobile or any other device is a day to day affair for most of the people. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the standard protocol used to send emails. IMAP and POP3 are the protocols to receive emails. IMAP has some advantages over the POP due to synchronization across the devices. So, a Mail transfer agent that open source and supports all these required protocols is crucial.

Running your mail transfer agent is a very tedious job and hence the choice you make for the MTA Software requires a deep analysis against your requirement matrix. Exim is one of the most flexible open source mail transfer agent which can be used as the replacement of the default mail transfer agent of the most UNIX systems..

Exim comes with a bundle of cutting edge features including Sendmail compatibility, cPanel Support, Flexible Configuration, and above all huge open source community support. Exim is like a framework with its application language to setup complex configurations. It has an advanced multi-step mail processing logic which helps it to solve complex use cases.

Sendmail is already lost to Postfix in all aspects, however, Postfix is less versatile then Exim. It has excellent integration support and it provides everything a system administrator can ask. Exim supports most of the Mail Transfer Agent features in some way or another.
